# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

A simple, interactive visualization of **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** built to help learners understand how the algorithm explores and evaluates paths through a graph.

## Features

- Grid-based interface with start and end nodes
- Walls/obstacles to simulate weighted graphs
- Step-by-step animation of how Dijkstra’s algorithm works
- Real-time updates showing visited nodes and shortest path
- Adjustable speed and grid layout (optional depending on version)
